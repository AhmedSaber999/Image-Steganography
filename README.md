# Image-Steganography
### Image steganography refers to hiding information i.e. text, images, or audio files in another image or video file. The current project aims to use steganography for an image with another image using the spatial domain technique. This hidden information can be retrieved only through proper decoding techniques. 

This encryption and decryption of the images are done using C# by implementing advanced number theory, advanced data structures, and algorithms (FFT - RSA).
