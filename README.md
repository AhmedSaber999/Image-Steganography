# Image-Steganography
###Image steganography refers to hiding information i.e. text, images or audio files in another image or video files. The current project aims to use steganography for an image with another image using spatial domain technique. This hidden information can be retrieved only through proper decoding technique.

 This encryption and decryption of the images is done using C# by implementing advanced number theory, advanced data structures and algorithms (FFT - RSA).
